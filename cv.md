## About me
I am 32 years old. I have a great interest in technical sciences and programming as well.

I started my career in 2012 as a communications and security systems engineer. During my work, I gained skills in setting up and programming network equipment and security systems. I have extensive experience in designing and configuring security alarm systems, video surveillance (working with rtsp streams) and access control.

In 2021, I completed the devops courses. This is an interesting direction for me, but I decided to develop as a full stack developer. I hope the front-end developer courses will be a good start on the way to my goal.

I also created several multi-page sites in Drupal and Joomla CMS. It helped me gain experience with html and css.
